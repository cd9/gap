# GAP: Generative Art Playground

This is an experiment with generating art using the Pillow library for Python.
The idea is to build up a set of classes that paint onto the canvas in wacky ways.

# Background

There was a need for a custom ace of diamonds card. This project may or may not completely halt in development after sufficient functionality is added to generate the ace.

# Features
- [x] Argument parsing
- [x] Star paint tool
- [x] Letter paint tool
- [ ] Border paint tool

# Sample
